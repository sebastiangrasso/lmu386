## Problem 3
f is a function that accepts two parameters: 
  1. Pointer to a function that accepts two parameters (int and an array of ints) and returns an int
  2. int
  
f returns a pointer to a function that takes in 1 or more ints and returns an int

## Problem 4
When redefining a feild in a C++ subclass, the subclass mantains the members of the ancestor class through the rules of class inheritance. The representation of a Derived object would contain two accesible b fields. To access the b of the Derived class, you would simply use the distinguisher b. In order to access the b belonging to the ancestor class, Base, you would have to use a scope resolution operator, which would look like Base::b.
